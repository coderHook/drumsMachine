# DrumStick Javascript (Vanilla Javascript)

## Brief
For some keys on the keyboard there is a sound assigned. When you press it, with an EventListener we grab the key code, also we use the data-name to identify the key pressed with the sound assigned and once we did that we play the sound. 

Also there is a change in the classes made with classList.remove on we after playing we remove the class to make it go to the initial state.

## Learnings:
 Key events, playing audio and listening for transitions and events.
